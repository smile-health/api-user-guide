The Role Matrix delineates the various functionalities and permissions assigned to different user roles within the Master Data service, specifically for Super Admin and Admin. It distinguishes between full access and view-only capabilities, providing a clear reference for understanding user responsibilities in managing master data. 

The matrix includes various settings, such as user management, entity management, and material data, detailing the specific actions each role can perform. This structured approach ensures clarity in access levels and enhances the management of master data across the system.
